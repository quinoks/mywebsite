            <h5><a href="4.html">The Philippine economy is projected to grow by 5.5 percent this year, driven by the growth in government spending, a report released by the First Metro Investment Corporation (FMIC) and the University of the Asia and the Pacific (UA&P) said.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
In the September issue of The Market Call released on Wednesday, FMIC and UA&P said Philippine economic growth in the third quarter of the year will likely reach 5.0 to 5.2 percent.
<br>
<br>
<br>
For the fourth quarter of this year, FMIC and UA&P project the country's gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 6 percent.
<br>
<br>
This would bring the full year GDP growth to 5.5 percent which is slightly below the government's 6 to 7 percent target for this year.

                <br>

                <br>
"Despite the weak July-August, we think the NG will accelerate further its spending on infrastructure and transportation for the rest of the year, and employment will have strong rebound in September," the report said.
<br>
<br>

The Philippine economy grew by 4.3 percent in the second quarter of this year.
<br>
<br>
During the quarter, government expenditure contracted by 7.1 percent.
<br>
<br>

FMIC and UA&P however expect government spending to accelerate in the second half of the year.
<br>
"National Government took up the slack in July spending as it ramped up expenditures by 16.2 percent year-on-year in July through higher social protection and infrastructure outlays," the report said.
<br>
<br>
Aside from government spending, FMIC and UA&P also expect manufacturing and construction to drive growth.
<br>
<br>

Transportation, storage, accommodations, food services and trade are also likely to drive growth.
<br>
<br>
The report meanwhile said inflation could fall to below 4 percent in November as food prices decline.
