            <h5><a href="4.html">Leading opposition figures have joined the calls for Vice President Sara Duterte to resign from President Marcos’ Cabinet if she plans on continuing to get involved in affairs that were beyond the mandates of her office.

                Among them were former Sen.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                 Leila de Lima and former Office of the Vice President spokesperson and lawyer Barry Gutierrez, who criticized Duterte for “meddling” into issues that were beyond her responsibilities as education secretary.

                 <br>
                 <br>
                  These include the ongoing debate on whether the Philippine government should cooperate with the International Criminal Court (ICC), as well as President Marcos’ decision to reach out again to the Communist rebels to revive the peace talks that stalled under her father and former President Rodrigo Duterte.

                <br>
                In the ICC’s case, Duterte had urged Congress against considering pending resolutions calling for cooperation in the ongoing ICC investigation into the drug war. She and her father are believed to be among those who could eventually face charges for their alleged role in extrajudicial killings committed by the so-called “Davao Death Squad” during their time as mayor and vice mayor of Davao City from 2011 to 2016.

                ‘Troubling patterns’
                As for the peace talks, Duterte personally appealed to Mr. Marcos not to enter into “an agreement with the devil” and to use his executive powers to review and reconsider the Oslo Joint Statement signed by the government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines.
